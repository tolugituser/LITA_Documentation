## Building Dashboards with Excel: E-Commerce Sales Analysis

### Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of an E-commerce business over the period of two years. By analysing the various parameters in the dataset received, I seek to gather enough insight to make informed and reasonable decisions which will ultimately enable me tell  compelling stories around the data and to know the best performance from the dataset.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Sales Data.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site.
