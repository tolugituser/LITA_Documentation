### Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of an E-commerce business over the period of two years. By analysing the various parameters in the dataset received, I seek to gather enough insight to make informed and reasonable decisions which will ultimately enable me tell  compelling stories around the data and to know the best performance from the dataset.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Sales Data.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis
   3.  For Data Visualization.

- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying & Analysis.
- Power BI for a Creating Report and Data Visualization.
- GitHub for Portfolio Building.

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparations
 In the initial phase of Data cleaning and prepparations, I perform the following actions;
 1. Data loading and Inspection
 2. Handling missing variables
 3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
---
This is where I add some lines of code, queries and DAX expressions used during analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
